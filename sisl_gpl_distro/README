The directories contain:

sisl/      - the GPL distribution of SISL 4.4
examples/  - example programs that links with SISL
streaming/ - additional functionality for streaming SISL objects to the 'Go' 
             format
viewer/    - a viewer to inspect SISL objects saved to file in the 'Go' format
	     (requires OpenGL)
doc/       - documentation: manual and users guide.

Makefiles are provided in each of the directories containing source code.  In
Linux, just type 'make lib' in each directory.  In windows, you might do the
same in CygWin (untested as of yet), or you might have to define a project in 
Visual Studio.

The code in the 'sisl' directory does not link with anything else and should 
be compiled first.  

The code in the 'streaming' directory links with 'sisl'.

The code in the 'examples' and 'viewer' directory links with 'sisl' and
'streaming'

The code in the 'viewer' directory also links with OpenGL, which must be 
available on your machine.
