To make the sisl 4.4 GPL distribution, run the script 'prepare_distro'.

The distribution will be created in a catalog called 'sisl_4.4_gpl'.

It will also be tarred and zipped into the file sisl_4.4_gpl.tgz.

The 'extras' catalog only contains the information necessary for the
'prepare_distro' script to make the GPL distribution.

Due to some latex-related problems, the user might have to push 'enter'
a couple of time during the process.
