How to make a GPL-distribution of SISL:

1) Update 'sisl': Ensure that you have checked out and updated
   SISL. Check that the CMakeLists.txt file contains relevant and
   updated CPack stuff. Check that the Doxyfile is updated.
2) Update the script 'generate_gpl_distro'. Pay attention to version
   numbers.
3) Update the files 'licence_header', 'ChangeLog','README', 'INSTALL',
   'COPYING' and 'excluded_files' (this can be empty).
4) Update the Manual and User's Guide in the 'doc' folder, if necessary.
5) cd to 'gpl' and run the script 'generate_gpl_distro'. This will
   generate a new GPL *source* directory, e.g. 'sisl-4.5.0'.
6) Make a build directory somewhere.
7) Run CMake to generate a Makefile, using the CMakeLists.txt
   generated in 5) as input.
8) Run 'make package_source'. This results in a .tar.gz file
   containing the GPL distro.
9) *TEST* the resulting .tar.gz file by unpacking, compiling, running
   any examples, and generating and examine the Doxygen documentation.
10) Make a tag in the SVN repository.

NOTE: Pay attention to version numbers!

Some other notes:
   
All code files will be processed before they are added to the GPL
distribution. Processing consists of stripping away the comment header
at the beginning of each file, and replacing it with a GPL-header.
